In the discussions on linear regression, decision-making models, linear programming, use and application of forecasts, and waiting lines theory, several key points emerged. Linear regression provides a valuable tool for analyzing relationships between variables and predicting outcomes. Decision-making models aid in rational and systematic decision-making processes. Linear programming enables optimization of resources and efficient allocation. Forecasts play a crucial role in strategic planning and resource management. Waiting lines theory helps in understanding queuing systems and optimizing service levels. The challenges that I personnally found the hardest in the course where how to include and control data quality, model assumptions, and apply these concepts in real-world implementations such as we did in the executive presentation of the "Whiskas case". Overall, these topics offer powerful analytical techniques for understanding and improving various aspects of business operations and decision-making. I appreciate a lot the disposition of the professor in solving our doubts and making the class as comprehensive as possible.
